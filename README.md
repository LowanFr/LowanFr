# 🎮 - Welcome on my profile !
First of all, my name is Esteban, and I'm a French student whose goal is to become a full stack developer, and I'm still far from it!
I'm passionate about cybersecurity, and I'm very interested in everything related to the space and computer security.
Also, I co-founded [Unosial](https://github.com/Unosial) with my old friend, [Franklin](https://github.com/AbaFranklin/), a group that aims to create tools for different platforms to simplify tasks. 

In the next few months, I plan to learn [Java](https://www.java.com/) as well as everything else needed for web development.
